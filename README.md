# AI-Powered-Workflow

An automated pipeline designed to analyze the emotional tone of security logs and forensic artifacts using n8n and Hugging Face AI.

### This project automates the process of categorizing text data specifically digital forensics notes and security alerts to determine their "sentiment" or severity. By leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), the workflow transforms raw, unstructured text into organized, actionable data stored in a Google Sheet for rapid review.
